# Quiz Me Like You Mean It
Quiz Me Like You Mean It is a mobile quiz game. Complete quizzes and fight with your friends on the leaderboard to claim the throne!

## Background
I developed this little app just to dip my feet into Jetpack Compose and to improve my Kotlin skills. I had enjoyed my time working with Kotlin at my second internship, so
I figured I'd create a small quiz game so I could do some more learning in my own time. The key takeaways from this experience was learning how to use Jetpack Compose and
how to design a straightforward yet aesthetically pleasing mobile UI.

Some features I'd like to add in the future are the ability to create your own quizzes, choose quizzes from a range of categories and to make the leaderboard live.
